            <h2>PHP Variables</h2>
            <p>The main way to store information in the middle of a PHP program is by using a variable.</p>
            <p>PHP has a total of eight data types which we use to construct our variables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Integers</b>: are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195</li>
                <li><b>Doubles</b>: are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or 49.1.</li>
                <li><b>Booleans</b>: have only two possible values either true or false.</li>
                <li><b>NULL</b>: is a special type that only has one value: NULL.</li>
                <li><b>Strings</b>: are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.'</li>
                <li><b>Arrays</b>: are named and indexed collections of other values.</li>
                <li><b>Objects</b>: are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class.</li>
                <li><b>Resources</b>: are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP (such as database connections).</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="constants">
            <h2>Constants</h2>
            <p>A constant is a name or an identifier for a simple value. A constant value cannot change
                during the execution of the script. By default, a constant is case-sensitive. By convention,
                constant identifiers are always uppercase. A constant name starts with a letter or underscore,
                followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. If you have defined a constant,
                it can never be changed or undefined.
                To define a constant you have to use define() function and to retrieve the value of a constant,
                you have to simply specifying its name. Unlike with variables, you do not need to have a
                constant with a $. You can also use the function constant() to read a constant's value if you
                wish to obtain the constant's name dynamically</p>

        <section id="operators">
            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p><b>What is Operator?</b> Simple answer can be given using expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here
                4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator. PHP language supports following type
                of operators.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arithemetic Operators</li>
                <li>Comparison Operators</li>
                <li>Logical (or Relational) Operators </li>
                <li>Assignment Operators</li>
                <li>Conditiona (or Ternary) Operators</li>
            </ul>
